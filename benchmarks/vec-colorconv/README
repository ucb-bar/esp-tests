COLORSPACE CONVERSION

This benchmark is based on a T0 benchmark program by Krste Asanovic.
Instead of taking an input RGB image, it generate a random RBG image within
the main binary.

The T0 program converts an input RGB image to a YCrCb image.  For more
info on colorspaces check out http://icsl.ee.washington.edu/

simply a ppm file, with the Y represented as red, the Cr as G, and Cb as
B.
